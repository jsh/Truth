"The truth is rarely pure and never simple." -- Oscar Wilde
"The truth shall set you free."

During a lecture the Oxford linguistic philosopher J. L. Austin made the claim that although a double negative in English implies a positive meaning, there is no language in which a double positive implies a negative. To which Morgenbesser responded in a dismissive tone, "Yeah, yeah."[1][2] (Some have quoted it as "Yeah, right.")
